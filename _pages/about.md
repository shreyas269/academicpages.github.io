Hello! It seems you have stumbled on my homepage.

I'm Shreyas Kulkarni, an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu). My primary research interests are in Security and Privacy of AI systems. Specifically, I am interested in Algorithmic Security and Privacy including the theory of Differential Privacy, as well as it's application in enhancing privacy of Machine Learning Algorithms.

I am working in the broad area of Adversarial ML, specifically Provable ML Robustness and Differential Privacy in ML in the Security Group at [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) mentored by [Dr. Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/). I completed my undergraduate studies in Engineering Physics and Mathematics from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in).

I am also interested in Statistics and Computational Learning Theory. Lately, I've been reading about the design of auctions and other pricing mechanisms with guarantees.

My hobbies include playing Soccer, Squash, solving puzzles, watching movies and reading non-fiction books.
