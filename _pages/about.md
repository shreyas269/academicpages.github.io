Hello! It seems you have stumbled on my homepage.

I'm Shreyas Kulkarni, a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science in the [College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu). My primary research interests are in Security and Privacy of AI systems. Specifically, I am interested in Algorithmic Security and Privacy and developing robust learning algorithms. Other than that, I am also interested in Game Theory, Statistics and Learning Theory.

Before starting my Ph.D. I worked in the broad area of Adversarial ML at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) and was fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Prateek Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/). Prior to that, I worked as a software engineer at [Symantec](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en) building products on the big-data stack to help in Cyber Safety of consumers. 
I completed my undergraduate studies in Engineering Physics and Mathematics from [IIT Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in).

My hobbies include playing soccer, squash, solving puzzles, watching movies and reading non-fiction books.
